          <p className="text-gray-600">
            Founded in 2024 by Harsh Walke, Feedlink was born out of a desire to reduce food waste and help communities thrive. We connect restaurants, volunteers, and organizations to ensure surplus food reaches those who need it most. What started as a local initiative in Pune has grown into a movement, inspiring others to join the fight against hunger.

            Our mission is to create a sustainable, compassionate network that makes food accessible to everyone, while minimizing waste and supporting local communities. We believe that no meal should go to waste and no person should go hungry.
